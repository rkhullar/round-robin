## Project Description

This project is an implementation of Round Robin CPU scheduling in python.  
Processes are stored as csv file separated with semi-colons. The columns should be in the following format:
[string];[int];[int] The columns represent the process name, arrival time, and burst time respectively.  
The demo simulates how the given processes would be scheduled with a time quantum.
